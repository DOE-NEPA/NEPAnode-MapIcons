Gov Webicons Set
=====================

Gov Webicons Set is a set of resolution-independent social icons for use on your website. They use feature-detected SVG graphics (with PNG fallbacks) to display the icons over their appropriate negatively indented anchor titles.

If you have icon suggestions, either submit a pull request or open an issue with a link to the SVG file of the agency you wish to see included.

Enjoy Gov Webicons!
